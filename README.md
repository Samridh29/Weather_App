## What you will create

By the end of the module, you will have made a beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app. You'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

## What I used and implemented in this app

* Impelmented dark mode
* Used the Openweatherapi to fecth the weather of of cities(https://openweathermap.org/current)
* Used CoreLocation to get the latitude and longitude of the users location.
* Used AVFoundation to Synthesize the speech for the weather.
